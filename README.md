# LC100A-Digital-Measuring-Program
I developed the LC100A measuring program for a microcontroller which is adapted and sold to measure Inductance (L) and Capacitance (C).
For my thesis I had to make a program which was able to convert the USB signal comming from the microcontroller. 
The microcontroller output was converted to a displayable graph so I could monitor capacitance output of capacitive sensorsoutput on my PC.
